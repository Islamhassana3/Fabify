# WooCommerce Integration - Custom Fabify Cart Removed

## Summary

The Fabify theme has been updated to remove all custom cart and checkout functionality. The theme now relies entirely on WooCommerce for e-commerce operations while maintaining its beautiful visual design.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Header (header.php)
- **Before**: Cart icon opened a custom sidebar cart
- **After**: Cart icon links directly to WooCommerce cart page
- **Features**: 
  - Displays real-time cart count from WooCommerce
  - Account link now points to WooCommerce My Account page
  - Cart count updates automatically via AJAX

### 2. Footer (footer.php)
- **Before**: Included a custom cart sidebar with overlay and toast notifications
- **After**: Clean footer without custom cart elements
- **Result**: Simpler, cleaner code that doesn't conflict with WooCommerce

### 3. JavaScript (custom.js)
- **Before**: 233 lines of custom cart logic
- **After**: 30 lines focused only on hero carousel
- **Removed**:
  - Custom cart state management
  - Manual cart item rendering
  - Custom quantity controls
  - Custom checkout button handler
  - Toast notifications
  - Overlay management
  - Custom AJAX cart handler

### 4. Functions (functions.php)
- **Removed**:
  - Custom AJAX handler for adding to cart
  - Custom product post type (fabify_product)
  - Custom cart nonce and AJAX localization
- **Added**:
  - WooCommerce cart fragments support for AJAX cart updates
  - Proper cart count synchronization

### 5. Product Display (front-page.php)
- **Before**: Custom button with data-product-id attribute
- **After**: Native WooCommerce add to cart button via `woocommerce_template_loop_add_to_cart()`
- **Benefits**:
  - Proper stock checking
  - Built-in AJAX functionality
  - Automatic redirect to cart/checkout based on WooCommerce settings
  - Variable product support
  - Proper product type handling

### 6. Styles (style.css)
- **Removed**: 230+ lines of custom cart CSS
  - Cart sidebar styles
  - Cart item styles
  - Overlay styles
  - Toast notification styles
  - Responsive cart styles
- **Added**: Styling for WooCommerce buttons to match theme design
  - `.button.product_type_simple`
  - `.button.add_to_cart_button`
  - `.button.ajax_add_to_cart`

## How It Works Now

### Adding Products to Cart
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" button on a product
2. WooCommerce handles the request via AJAX
3. Cart count updates automatically in the header
4. WooCommerce shows its own notification (can be customized via WooCommerce settings)
5. User can continue shopping or click cart icon to view cart

### Viewing Cart
1. User clicks cart icon in header
2. Redirects to WooCommerce cart page (`/cart`)
3. WooCommerce displays full cart with all items
4. User can update quantities, remove items, apply coupons, etc.

### Checkout Process
1. User clicks "Proceed to Checkout" on WooCommerce cart page
2. Redirects to WooCommerce checkout page (`/checkout`)
3. WooCommerce handles entire checkout process:
   - Billing/shipping information
   - Payment gateway integration
   - Order confirmation
   - Email notifications
   - Order management

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Reliability

### 3. Maintainability

- Theme updates won't affect cart functionality

### 4. Features
